# Let's invite A(R)lice from Wonderland to our browsers #

This repo contains examples from my talk *Let's invite A(R)lice from Wonderland to our browsers* 
which were presented during [4developers 2021](https://4developers.org.pl/) conference.

Examples below are written in "demo mode", please not treat as a reference for production ready solution.
Main and only goal of those examples is to show how easy is to start with AR in JavaScript.


## Examples ##

Examples were created based on following materials:

* [Immersive Web Samples](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/)
* [Three.js examples ](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_cloth)
* [Model Viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/)


All credits goes to tutorial authors

## Run Examples ##
Examples can be tested [here](https://kamyk-pl.github.io/4-developers-2021-examples/index.html),

or locally.

To run example locally run following commands.
` 
npm install
`

and then 

`
npm run serve
`

Remember that your mobile device and your computer have to be in the same Wi-Fi network.
Some time you have to also adjust Windows firewall settings.

AR experience requires *https*  connection. Dummy certificate is committed in the repo which helps you with local deployment.
You will have to accept this certificate in the browser.
